Become an Architect - 1 - Code Reviews

My Takeaways:
1) No 1 Thing to look at in Code Reviews: Readability (and Tools don't have clue)
2) Coding is more nearer to Art rather than Science. Automation can help review parts of coding that are nearer to Science.
3) Best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago! The best time to bring automated reviews is Yesterday.
