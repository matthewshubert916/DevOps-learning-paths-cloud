80-20 Rule, Finding what works for me, Putting myself in uncomfortable situations, Unlearning fast, Getting into a flow, Using Pomodoro technique, Getting hands-on at the right time: These are some of the ways I learn fast.

Koushik and Siva have been continuously learning technology and evolving with it for the last two decades. We discuss how we learn and our attitude towards learning.

My Three (actually four) Takeaways:
1: Learning is something specific to an individual. Workout what works for you.
2: Focus on building something rather than on frameworks and tools.
3: Spend time identifying what tool/framework/language to learn. 
4: Choose to go hands-on at the right time. 

What are your takeaways?
