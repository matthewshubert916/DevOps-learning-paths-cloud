### Script

```
- Organizing Code - Why is it important?
- What are the options?
	- Decision Levels: Method, Class, Package, Layer, Component, Microservice
		- Package by Layer vs Package by Feature
- What principles do you consider?
	- SRP
	- Encapsulation
	- Coupling
	- Cohesion
- Cross-Cutting Concerns: Authentication, Authorization, Logging, Tracing..
- Orthogonal Architecture
- Impact of Architecture style: Microservices, Monolith, Event-Driven on how we organize code
- Advantages of having the standard structure - Ex: Maven
- Advantages of having smaller components
