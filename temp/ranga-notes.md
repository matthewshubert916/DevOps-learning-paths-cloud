Learning AWS, Learning Azure, Learning Google Cloud is much easier than learning programming. Learning Docker, Learning Kubernetes, Learning Terraform is much easier than learning to write great unit test, learning to simplify design and architectures.

80-20 Rule, Finding what works for me, Putting myself in uncomfortable situations, Unlearning fast, Getting into a flow, Using Pomodoro technique, Getting hands-on at the right time: These are some of the ways I learn fast.

And I'm delighted to have Koushik and Siva who have been continuously learning technology and evolving with it for the last two decades.


Koushik and Siva - Welcome to today's discussion

My Three (actually four) Takeaways:
1: Learning is something specific to an individual. Workout what works for you.
2: Focus on building something rather than on frameworks and tools.
3: Use 80-20 rule. Spend time identifying what tool/framework/language to learn. 
4: Choose to go hands-on at the right time. 

What are your takeaways?

How do you keep with the change in technology?
How do you learn?
What is your learning approach?
What do you like to learn from - books/courses/videos/documentation?
What is the importance of building T-shaped skills?
Do you have a specific environment or time where you learn?


### Google Cloud Digital Leader

Google Cloud Digital Leader certification was introduced in 2021. However, it is now among the most popular Google Cloud certifications. Why is this certification so popular?

Programmers, Business Analysts, Testers, sometime even Architects are among the roles of the people attempting this certification. What makes this certification the best place to start learning Google Cloud?

Learners take somewhere between 1 to 4 weeks to clear this certification. What is the step by step approach you can take to clear this certification? 

AND

The certification has been updated drastically very recently. What has changed?


We will discuss these aspects with Sathish VJ (AwesomeGCP) and our own Amit. Sathish, GK, Amit and I have all cleared this certification. 

Welcome!

And Amit will moderate the discussion for us. Let's get started! Over to you Amit!

### Microservices

The most popular architectural style today is microservices architecture. Beginners to microservices are overwhelmed with a tools and frameworks in building microservices - Docker, Kubernetes and Spring Cloud. 

I have the experience of helping more than 100,000 learners start their microservices journey. In this video, Amit and I will discuss the fundamentals of microservices and help a beginner to microservices understand how they can start their journey to microservices. 

Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud and Spring Cloud might seem difficult at the start. But if you understand how they fit in and the value they bring in, they become easier to learn! 
Let's make microservices easier to learn. Let's get started. 

Delighted to have you here Amit!


### Microservices - V2

The most popular architectural style today is microservices architecture. Beginners to microservices are overwhelmed with a tools and frameworks in building microservices - Docker, Kubernetes and Spring Cloud. 

In the last video, we got a 10,000 feet overview of microservices. In this video, let's dig deeper into some of the important aspects of microservices. We will take a couple of example microservices and discuss the microservice features in depth. We will discuss the role played by Docker, Kubernetes and Spring Cloud as well.

Let's get started.

Delighted to have you here Amit!
