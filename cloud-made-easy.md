## Why Cloud?

Let's consider a couple of example use cases. 

Usecase 1: Let's start with a online shopping application. 

What is the challenge that an online shopping application faces? 

Online shopping applications typically have peak usage during holidays and weekends. For example, during the Christmas period and the New Year period, you would have a lot of load on the application and rest of the time you will have low loads on the application. 

What was the solution before the cloud? The solution before the cloud was to do peak load provisioning. Buy infrastructure for peak load. Think about this: What would that infrastructure be doing in periods of low load? It would be sitting idle. 

Usecase 2: Take a start-up. 

Imagine a scenario: startup suddenly becomes popular. How do you handle the sudden increase in the load? 

What was the solution before the cloud? Procure infrastructure assuming that you would be successful. What if startup is not successful? All the infrastructure bought is wasted. 

Typical challenges before the emergence of cloud are
1. High cost of procuring infrastructure
2. Needs ahead of time planning (Can you really guess the future?)
3. Low infrastructure utilization
4. Needs a dedicated infrastructure maintenance team to maintain the infrastructure

Think about a start-up. Can they afford a dedicated infrastructure maintenance team? 

Whenever we use the cloud, we are talking about a simple question: How about provisioning or renting resources when we want them and releasing them back to the cloud when you do not need them? 

This is also called on-demand resource provisioning. 

If you have high load on your application, if you have huge number of users using the application, you'll provision or you will rent a lot of resources from the cloud. 

And once the load goes down, once the number of users on your application goes down, you'll release the resources back to the cloud. 

This is also called elasticity. 

What are the advantages of this approach? 

1. You're trading capital expense for variable expense. Instead of investing money ahead of time, you are paying rent. 
2. You can benefit from the massive economies of scale. Each of the popular cloud providers have millions of servers and therefore they can get the best deals from the hardware providers. And because the cloud space is very competitive, the cloud providers pass on that advantage to their customers, that's us. 
3. You don't really need to guess capacity anymore. If the number of users increase, you can provision more servers. If the number of users goes down, you can release them back to the cloud. 
4. You can go global in minutes. Imagine a start-up in India. They can easily deploy an application to multiple regions around the world with a click of a button and that's what cloud enables.
