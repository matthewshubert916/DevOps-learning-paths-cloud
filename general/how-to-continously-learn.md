@Koushik Kothagal, @Siva Prasad Reddy Katamreddy and I have seen this evolution during our two decades of experience building software. 

And that's what we talk about in this video!

### Planned Script Outline

```
How can you become a great programmer, a great tech lead or a great architect? What are the skills you need to focus? Is it just technology, language, frameworks and tools? Or is there more to it?

I'm delighted to bring this new series of videos focusing on the the finer aspects of programming! And what's more exciting?  Koushik (from Java Brains) and Siva (from Siva Labs) will join in. Koushik is joining in from the silicon valley. Siva is joining in from the hitech city or the cyber city as we call it. Welcome Koushik and Siva. Glad to have you both here.

Devices are exploding - computers to laptops to mobile devices to IOT devices. Today, we are generating exponential times more data than ever before. Software development processes are evolving - Waterfall to Agile to DevOps. And technology is evolving too - New Languages, New Frameworks and the emergence of cloud. There is a constant need to reskill and that's the biggest challenge in today's technology world. How do you upskill? How do you keep up with the changing trends?

Do you use the same approach to learn programming, design, architecture, frameworks and tools?

@Koushik Kothagal, @Siva Prasad Reddy Katamreddy and I have seen this evolution during our two decades of experience building software. 

In this video, we share our experiences with learning things.
