### Google Cloud Digital Leader

Google Cloud Digital Leader certification was introduced in 2021. However, it is now among the most popular Google Cloud certifications. Why is this certification so popular?

Programmers, Business Analysts and Testers are among the roles of the people attempting this certification. What makes this certification the best place to start learning Google Cloud? 

In my experience, learners take somewhere between 1 to 4 weeks to clear this certification. What is the step by step approach you can take to clear this certification? 

We will discuss with Sathish VJ (AwesomeGCP), GK (cloud advocate) and Amit. Sathish, GK, Amit and I have all cleared this certification. We are all excited to share our experiences with you. 

And Amit will moderate the discussion for us. Let's get started! Over to you Amit!

### SDLC



### Kubernetes

The most popular architectural style today is microservices architecture. Learning microservices can be very difficult. But if you break it down and take the right approach, learning microservices can be really easy.

I have the experience of helping more than 100,000 learners start their microservices journey. In this video, Amit and I will discuss the fundamentals of microservices and help a beginner to microservices understand how they can start their journey to microservices. 

Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud and Spring Cloud might seem difficult at the start. But if you understand how they fit in and the value they bring in, they become easier to learn! 
Let's make microservices easier to learn. Let's get started. 

Delighted to have you here Amit!
