### Script Outline

- 3 minute overview of SDLC
- Our experiences with things in the agile manifesto (while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more)
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	- Responding to change over following a plan
- Pickup important principles and talk about them
	- Working software is the primary measure of progress
	- Early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
	- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
	- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
	- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
	- Simplicityâ€“the art of maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€“is essential.
	- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
	- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
