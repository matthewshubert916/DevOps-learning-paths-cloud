### Script

It is no exaggeration to say I'm with three of the most influential content creators in the Indian programming world today.

- Importance of Continuous Learning
- I know continuous learning might sound boring. But it's the most interesting thing in my career. Doing things one way and being able to do them a different way - a better way soon after. I found joy there.
	- Is that your experience too?
	- How do you find motivation for doing this?
- Technology changes so fast
	-How do you keep up with it?
	-What's your approach to learning?
	-Differentiate between different things to learn
- My journey. JSP > Servlets > ... > Cloud/DevOps. But learners today don't have that flexibility. They are expected to learn a lot of things. How do they manage?
	- Focus is the most important thing. Spend time choosing and stick to one.
- I will get to the most boring question ever - Java, JavaScript or Python. How does somebody starting their programming career choose?
- My journey with topcoder. What's the role of competitive programming and hackathons?
- Building Applications is one of the approaches to start learning. Where do I go once I think I'm pretty decent with programming?
	- Data Structures, Algorithms, System Design, Building Applications or Cloud or DevOps
- Full Stack and T-shaped skills
- Importance of learning to debug problems?
- Importance of being good at the IDE
- How to build a great Github profile?
- Where do you see Cloud in 20 years from now? Whats the right time to learn the cloud?
- Tier 2, Tier 3 colleges and opportunities out there
- Object-Oriented Programming is a no-brainer. Should you explore multiple languages? Where do you see industry heading?
	- Multiple styles: Pure functional, functional, reactive
	- Languages: Go, Rust, Kotlin ..
- Building real-world projects is a different cup of tea
	- Extreme Programming Practices - Design, Unit Testing, TDD, Pair Programming
- Some people want to be programmers for their lifetime. Some want to grow in their career to Architects or Tech leads:
	- Role of communication, working in a team, soft-skills
	- How to learn to be better at working in a team?
- Content creation journeys. Continuously creating content is a big challenge:
	- How do you motivate yourselves?
	- Time off: How do you take a break from work?
	- What would you tell a Young Koushik? How would you do things differently?
	- There are so many things to learn. How do you focus?
- Ending
	- Any project you want to highlight? What can learners expect to see in future?
	- Anything that you think I missed asking?
- Excellence is a habit. Each of the three people you are seeing here is an example of it. They found their own way to be consistent and learn every day. Learning enables you to be great at the job. Go ahead keep learning every day and I will see you again!
