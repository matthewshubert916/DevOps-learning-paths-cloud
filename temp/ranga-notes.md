### Google Cloud Digital Leader

Google Cloud Digital Leader certification was introduced in 2021. However, it is now among the most popular Google Cloud certifications. Why is this certification so popular?

Programmers, Business Analysts and Testers are among the roles of the people attempting this certification. What makes this certification the best place to start learning Google Cloud? 

In my experience, learners take somewhere between 1 to 4 weeks to clear this certification. What is the step by step approach you can take to clear this certification? 

We will discuss with Sathish VJ (AwesomeGCP), GK (cloud advocate) and Amit. Sathish, GK, Amit and I have all cleared this certification. We are all excited to share our experiences with you. 

And Amit will moderate the discussion for us. Let's get started! Over to you Amit!

### SDLC

How can you become a great programmer, a great tech lead or a great architect? What are the skills you need to focus? Is it just technology, language, frameworks and tools? Or is there more to it?

I'm delighted to bring this new series of videos focusing on the the finer aspects of programming! And what's more exciting?  Koushik (from Java Brains) and Siva (from Siva Labs) will join in. Koushik is joining in from the silicon valley. Siva is joining in from the hitech city or the cyber city as we call it. Welcome Koushik and Siva. Glad to have you both here.

Building software involves multiple steps - gathering requirements, documenting them, architecture, design, coding, testing, deployment and operations. Each of these steps involve people playing multiple roles. How do you ensure that the software you are developing is of the highest quality?  That's where the Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC comes into picture. We started with waterfall evolved to agile and today we talk about devops (and SRE). 

Koushik, Siva and Me have seen this evolution during our two decades of experience building software. 

This evolution of SDLC from waterfall to agile to devops will be today's focus. 

Koushik, do you want start with an overview of waterfall and your experiences with it?
