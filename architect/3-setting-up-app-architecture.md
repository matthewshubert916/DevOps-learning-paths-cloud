### Script

```
Here are a few pointers for our next discussion: Deciding App Architecture
1. Modularity (Coupling, Cohesion)
2. Layering (Multi-Tier)
3. Domain Model
4. Stateful vs Stateless
5. Choosing Technology (Language, Framework, Tools.. )
6. Cross Cutting Concerns
7. Implementing with Agility (Vertical Slice, Architecturally significant challenges)
