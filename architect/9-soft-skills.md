### Video Editing Guidelines

- VIDEO EDITING: 
	- IMPORTANT - Second HALF of the VIDEO - Kaushik said that his wife and kid make an appearance in the video for a few seconds. I tried for a few minutes but was unable to find the exact moment in the timeline. Can we edit it out? Koushik is very particular about it!
