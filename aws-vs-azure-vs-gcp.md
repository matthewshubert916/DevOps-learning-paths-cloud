		- Resources in a private subnet **CANNOT** be accessed from internet
		- BUT resources in public subnet can talk to resources in private subnet
		- Each Subnet is created in an Availability Zone 
		- VPC - us-east-1 => Subnets - AZs us-east-1a or us-east-1b or ..
- Users can 
	- Select IP address range 
	- Add/update address ranges
	- Configure route tables & network gateways.

---
## Azure Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnets
- Azure Virtual Network is similar to AWS VPC
- Subnet in AWS is also called Subnet in Azure
- You can create your own custom Vnets and subnets
	- You can create different types of resources in different subnets
	- You can setup Virtual network peering between Vnets to connect different Vnets

---
## Google Cloud VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and Subnets

<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/vpc.png)

- VPC and Subnets in GCP are very similar to AWS:
	- Default VPCs are provided with default subnets
	- You can create your own custom VPCs and subnets
	- You can create different types of resources in different subnets
	- You can use VPC flow logs to debug problems
	- You can setup peering between VPCs to connect different VPCs
	- You can create Shared VPCs to share resources across multiple GCP projects or AWS accounts
- However, it is important to note the differences:
	- In AWS, VPCs are regional and Subnets belong to an Availability Zone
		- However, in GCP VPCs are global and Subnets belong to specific region
	- There are significant differences in default VPCs and subnets configuration
		- In GCP, default VPCs are created per project
			- Each default VPC has multiple subnets - one in each region

# Organizing Resources
---
## Organizing Resources
- Azure: Account > Management group > Subscriptions > Resource groups > Resources
- Google Cloud: Organization (or Account) > Folders > Projects > Resources
- AWS: AWS Organization > AWS Account(s) > Resources
- Key things to remember:
	- Google Cloud Projects and Azure Subscriptions can be moved to different owner (Account or Organization). However, AWS resources are tied to an AWS Account.
	- A Google Cloud project is conceptually similar to the Azure subscription, in terms of billing, quotas, and limits.
		- However, from a functional perspective, a Google Cloud project is more like a resource group in Azure. It's a logical unit that cloud resources are deployed to.

---
## Organizing Resources in AWS
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/organizations.png) 

- Where do we create resources in AWS?
	- In an AWS Account!
	- By default, you will be billed per AWS Account!
- What if you want to create resources for multiple environments?
	- One of the recommended approaches is to create separate AWS accounts
		- Each AWS account provides natural security, access and billing boundaries
		- Create **AWS Organization** to organize accounts into Organizational Units (OU)
			- Consolidated bill for AWS accounts
		- Use **AWS Resource Access Manager** to share AWS resources:
			- Share AWS Transit Gateways, Subnets, AWS License Manager configurations etc

---
## Resource Hierarchy in GCP
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-sixty" -->
![](./images/02-architecture/resource-hierarchy-overview.png)
source: (https://cloud.google.com)
- **Well defined hierarchy**:
	- Organization > Folder > Project > Resources
- **Resources** are created in projects
- A **Folder** can contain multiple projects
- **Organization** can contain multiple Folders


## Azure Resource Hierarchy

<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-thirty" -->
![](./images/azure/rbac-scope-no-label.png)
(https://docs.microsoft.com/)

- **Hierarchy**: Management Group(s) > Subscription (s) > Resource Group (s) > Resources
	- **Resources**: VMs, Storage, Databases
	- **Resource groups**: Organize resources by grouping them into Resource groups
	- **Subscriptions**: Manage costs for resources provisioned for different teams or different projects or different business units
	- **Management groups**: Centralized management for access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions
- **Remember**:
	- No hierarchy in resource groups BUT management groups can have a hierarchy

---
## Resource Groups

<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/azure/dev-and-qa.png)

- **Resource Group**: Logical container for resources
	- Associated with a single subscription
	- Can have multiple resources
		- (REMEMBER) A resource can be associated with one and only one resource group
	- Can have resources from multiple regions
	- Deleting it deletes all resources under it
- **Subscriptions**: Subscription links Azure Account to its resources
	- You need a Subscription to create resources in Azure
	- An Azure Account can have multiple subscriptions and multiple account administrators
- **Management Groups**: Allows you to manage access, policies, and compliance across multiple subscriptions
	- Group subscriptions into **Management Groups**
	- All subscriptions & resources under a Management Group inherit all constraints applied to it
	- (REMEMBER) You can create a hierarchy of management groups

## Relational Databases
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-fifty" -->
![Database](./images/aws/relational-schema.png)
- This was the **only option** until a decade back!
- Most **popular (or unpopular)** type of databases
- **Predefined schema** with tables and relationships
- Very **strong transactional** capabilities
- Used for 
	- OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) use cases and
	- OLAP (Online Analytics Processing) use cases

---
## Relational Database - OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/sql.png)
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/spanner.png) 
- Applications where **large number of users make large number of small transactions** ( small reads & updates)
	- **Use cases**: Most traditional applications, ERP, CRM, e-commerce, banking applications
- **Popular databases**: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server etc
- Recommended AWS Services
	- **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service) - (Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB (Enhanced MySQL), Oracle Database, and SQL Server)
		- Amazon Aurora Provides "Global Database" option
- Recommended GCP Services: 
	- **Cloud SQL** : Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server for regional relational databases (upto a few TBs)
	- **Cloud Spanner**: Unlimited scale (multiple PBs) and 99.999% availability for global applications with horizontal scaling
- Recommended Azure Services: 
	- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed Microsoft SQL Server
	- **Azure Database for MySQL**: Managed MySQL
	- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**: Managed PostgreSQL

---
## Relational Database - OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/bigquery.png) 
- Applications allowing users to **analyze petabytes of data**
	- **Examples** : Reporting applications, Data ware houses, Business intelligence applications, Analytics systems
	- **Sample application** : Decide insurance premiums analyzing data from last hundred years
	- Data is consolidated from multiple (transactional) databases
- Recommended AWS Managed Service: **Amazon Redshift**
- Recommended GCP Managed Service: **BigQuery**
- Recommended Azure Managed Service: **Azure Synapse Analytics**

---
## NoSQL Databases
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-ten" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/datastore.png)
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/big-query.png)
- **New approach** (actually NOT so new!) to building your databases
	- NoSQL = not only SQL
	- Flexible schema
		- Structure data **the way your application needs it**
		- Let the schema evolve with time
	- Horizontally scale to petabytes of data with millions of TPS
- **NOT a 100% accurate generalization** but a great starting point:
	- Typical NoSQL databases trade-off "Strong consistency and SQL features" to achieve "scalability and high-performance"
- **AWS Managed Services**:Amazon DynamoDB & Amazon DocumentDB
- **Google Managed Services**: Cloud Firestore (Datastore) &  Cloud BigTable
- **Azure Managed Service**: Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin,.. APIs)

---
## Cloud Firestore (Datastore) vs Cloud BigTable
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-ten" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/datastore.png)
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/big-query.png)
- **Cloud Datastore** - Managed serverless NoSQL document database
	- Provides ACID transactions, SQL-like queries, indexes
		- Designed for transactional mobile and web applications
	- Firestore (next version of Datastore) adds:
		- Strong consistency
		- Mobile and Web client libraries
	- Recommended for small to medium databases (0 to a few Terabytes)
- **Cloud BigTable** - Managed, scalable NoSQL wide column database
	- NOT serverless (You need to create instances)
	- Recommend for data size > 10 Terabytes to several Petabytes
	- Recommended for large analytical and operational workloads:
		- NOT recommended for transactional workloads (Does NOT support multi row transactions - supports ONLY Single-row transactions)

---
## In-memory Databases
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/memorystore.png) 
- **Retrieving data from memory is much faster than retrieving data from disk**
- In-memory databases like Redis deliver microsecond latency by storing **persistent data in memory**
- Recommended AWS Managed Service 
	- **Amazon ElastiCache** (Redis and Memcached)
- Recommended GCP Managed Service 
	- **Memorystore** (Redis and Memcached)
- Recommended Azure Managed Service 
	- **Azure Cache** (Redis)
- **Use cases** : Caching, session management, gaming leader boards, geospatial applications

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-fifty" -->
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/0-SQS-00.png)
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/0-SQS-01.png)
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/3-SNS.png)

- Synchronous Communication:
	- What if your logging service goes down?
		- Will you applications go down too?
	- What if there is high load?
		- Log Service unable to handle and goes down
- Asynchronous Communication:
	- Create a queue or a topic
		- Your applications put the logs on the queue
		- Picked up when the logging service is ready
	- Good example of decoupling!
	- (Possible) Multiple logging service instances reading from the queue!
- Two Types:
	- Pull based
	- Push based
---

|Producer Consumer (using Pull)|Simple Queue Service (SQS)|Cloud Pub/Sub|Queue Storage, Azure Service Bus|
|Publish Subscribe (Push)|Simple Notification Service (SNS)|Cloud Pub/Sub|Azure Service Bus|
|Real-time data ingestion service (event-driven systems and streaming analytics)|Amazon Kinesis|Cloud Pub/Sub|Azure Event Hubs|
---
## AWS - Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-thirty" -->
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/0-SQS-01.png)
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/3-SNS.png)
- Pull Based: **Amazon SQS**
	- Producers put messages. Consumers poll on queue.
		- Only one of the consumers will successfully process a message
	- Standard Queue 
		- Unlimited throughput
		- BUT NO guarantee of ordering (Best-Effort Ordering) 
		- and NO guarantee of exactly-once processing
	- FIFO (first-in-first-out) Queue
		- First-In-First-out Delivery, Exactly-Once Processing
		- BUT throughput is lower 
- Push Based: **Amazon SNS**
	- 1: Create an SNS Topic
	- 2: Subscribers can register for a Topic
	- 3: When an SNS Topic receives an event notification (from publisher), it is broadcast to all Subscribers

---
## Messaging in GCP - Pub/Sub
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-ten" -->
![](./images/00-icons/gcp/pub-sub.png)
- Reliable, scalable, fully-managed asynchronous messaging service
- Backbone for **Highly Available** and **Highly Scalable** Solutions
	- Auto scale to process billions of messages per day
	- Low cost (Pay for use)
- Supports push and pull message deliveries
- Pub/Sub does NOT guarantee message ordering 
	- BUT there are mitigation options --enable-message-ordering
- Pub/Sub does NOT guarantee exactly-once delivery
	- Applications can handle duplicate messages

---
## Pub/Sub - Sending and Receiving a Message
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-forty" -->
![](./images/02-Architecture/00-pubsub-messageflow.png)
- Publisher sends a message to Topic
- Message **individually** delivered to each and every subscription
	- Subscribers can receive message either by:
		- Push: Pub/Sub sends the message to Subscriber
		- Pull: Subscribers poll for messages
- Subscribers send acknowledgement(s)
- Message(s) are removed from subscriptions message queue
	- Pub/Sub ensures the message is retained **per subscription** until it is acknowledged
