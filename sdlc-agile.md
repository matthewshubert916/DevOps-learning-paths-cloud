SDLC: Waterfall to Agile to DevOps

Koushik (https://javabrains.io/), Siva (https://www.sivalabs.in/) and Ranga discuss the evolution of SDLC from Waterfall to Agile to DevOps

Building software involves multiple steps - gathering requirements, documenting them, architecture, design, coding, testing, deployment and operations. Each of these steps involve people playing multiple roles. How do you ensure that the software you are developing is of the highest quality?  That's where the Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC comes into picture. We started with waterfall, evolved to agile and today we talk about devops (and SRE). 

Koushik, Siva and I have seen this evolution during our two decades of experience building software.

Building software involves multiple steps - gathering requirements, documenting them, architecture, design, coding, testing, deployment and operations. Each of these steps involve people playing multiple roles. 

How do you ensure that you are building what your customer wants (build the right product)? 

How do you ensure that the process followed helps you build the product of the highest quality? (build the product right) 

That's where the Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC comes into picture. We started with waterfall, evolved to agile and today we talk about devops (and SRE). 

@Koushik Kothagal, @Siva Prasad Reddy Katamreddy and I have seen this evolution during our two decades of experience building software. 

And that's what we talk about in this video!

How can you become a great programmer, a great tech lead or a great architect? What are the skills you need to focus? Is it just technology, language, frameworks and tools? Or is there more to it?

I'm delighted to bring this new series of videos focusing on the the finer aspects of programming! And what's more exciting?  Koushik (from Java Brains) and Siva (from Siva Labs) will join in. Koushik is joining in from the silicon valley. Siva is joining in from the hitech city or the cyber city as we call it. Welcome Koushik and Siva. Glad to have you both here.

Koushik, Siva and I have seen this evolution during our two decades of experience building software. 

This evolution of SDLC from waterfall to agile to devops will be today's focus of discussion.

Overview of DevOps



- 3 minute overview of SDLC
- Our experiences with things in the agile manifesto (while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more)
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	- Responding to change over following a plan
- Pickup important principles and talk about them
	- Working software is the primary measure of progress
	- Early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
	- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
	- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
	- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
	- Simplicityâ€“the art of maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€“is essential.
	- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
	- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
