# Cloud Influencer Campaign

## Goal
- Position ourselves as the place to **start cloud journeys** - AWS, Azure and Google Cloud
	- Focus on **Beginner** Courses:
		- Google Cloud: https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-digital-leader-certification/
		- Azure: https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-certification-az-900-azure-fundamentals/
		- AWS: https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-step-by-step/

## Our differentiators
- Almost **one million learners** on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/user/in28minutes/)
	- Maybe the **No 1 Udemy instructor** in India
- **Multi cloud** instructor - Teaching AWS, Azure and Google Cloud
	- I don't know any other instructor who teaches multiple clouds
- Expertise on Serverless, Containers, Microservices, Full Stack, Cloud and DevOps
- **Great Reviews** on All our Courses (including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud courses)
- **Price Differentiation**: All our competitors in India offer cloud solutions at very expensive prices. An in28minutes cloud certification course (with all its amazing reviews and flexibility of learning whenever a learner wants to learn) costs less than RS 1000.
